NNKit: A dynamic neural network framework.

NNKit is a framework for training neural network models. It is based on the concept
of dynamic computation graphs, where graphs are implicitly generated on each forward pass by
passing the results of one node to the next.

This dynamic approach makes it practical to implement recurrent topologies for varying length inputs
and allows generating graphs with a minimal amount of code.

The framework includes several kinds of operators as well as the most used loss nodes and optimizers.
